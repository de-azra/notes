I got myself an old Cisco 2960 switch and while trying to set it up with a base configuration to use in my homelab, I realized that although I spent several months of my life with Cisco switches, I have pretty much forgotten everything... yeah. So I decided to note down all the relevant stuff - should I ever need to do this again.
